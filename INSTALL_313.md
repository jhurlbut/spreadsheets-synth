## TRANSMISSION CODES
Version: 303.909.808
Frequency: Underground
Resistance: Active

## NAVIGATION COORDINATES

### macOS [DREXCIYA PROTOCOL]

#### AU Component (808 Hz Native Frequency)
1. Download `SpreadsheetsSynth_AU_v1.0.0.zip`
2. Extract the component from its compression chamber
3. Navigate to coordinates: `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/`
   - If the path is submerged, surface it with: `mkdir -p ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/`
4. Drop the `Spreadsheets Synth.component` into the frequency pool
5. Clear the sonic cache: `killall -9 AudioComponentRegistrar`
6. Rescan in your DAW (the midnight protocol)

#### VST3 (x0x Pattern)
1. Download `SpreadsheetsSynth_VST3_v1.0.0.zip`
2. Decompress the rhythm matrix
3. Navigate to coordinates: `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`
   - Create the underground path if needed: `mkdir -p ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`
4. Transfer `Spreadsheets Synth.vst3` to the designated sector
5. Initiate DAW rescan sequence

#### Standalone Application (Direct Jack)
1. Download `SpreadsheetsSynth_Standalone_macOS_v1.0.0.zip`
2. Extract the application from temporal compression
3. Move to `/Applications/` or run from any coordinate
4. First launch: Right-click → Open (bypass the surface world security)

### Windows [BELLEVILLE THREE PROTOCOL]

#### VST3 (Techno City Alignment)
1. Download `SpreadsheetsSynth_VST3_v1.0.0.zip`
2. Extract the plugin from data compression
3. Navigate to standard VST3 coordinates:
   - System: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\`
   - User: `C:\Users\[YOUR_CIPHER]\Documents\VST3\`
4. Copy `Spreadsheets Synth.vst3` to the chosen frequency
5. Rescan plugins in your DAW (WJLB protocol)

## TROUBLESHOOTING TRANSMISSIONS

### Signal Not Found [303 Emergency]
- Verify the plugin reached correct coordinates
- Clear plugin cache in DAW preferences
- Restart the DAW (power cycle the generator)
- Check if running in Rosetta mode (M1 translation matrix)

### Authorization Blocked [UR Security]
**macOS Gatekeeper Bypass:**
```bash
sudo spctl --master-disable  # Enter the underground
# Install plugin
sudo spctl --master-enable   # Return to surface
```

**Alternative frequency:**
```bash
xattr -cr "Spreadsheets Synth.component"  # Remove quarantine signal
```

### Windows Defender Interference [313 Static]
1. Navigate to Windows Security
2. Add exclusion for plugin folder
3. Re-extract from the original transmission

## VERIFICATION SEQUENCE

### macOS Terminal [Mad Mike's Console]
```bash
# Verify AU installation
auval -a | grep -i spreadsheet

# Expected response:
# aumu Sprd Sprl - SpreadsheetsLabs: SpreadsheetsSynth
```

### Both Systems [The Wizard's Test]
1. Load your DAW
2. Create new instrument track
3. Browse to: Spreadsheets > SpreadsheetsSynth
4. Load the plugin
5. Press any key between C-1 and C-8
6. The acid signal should propagate

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- **Frequency Response:** 20Hz - 20kHz
- **Operating Voltage:** ±12V (People Mover compatible)
- **Temperature:** 313K (constant)
- **Timeline:** Past/Future/Now
- **RAM:** Minimum 606MB
- **CPU:** Any processor that understands the funk

## UNINSTALL SEQUENCE [RETURN TO ZERO]

### macOS
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/"Spreadsheets Synth.component"
rm -rf ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/"Spreadsheets Synth.vst3"
```

### Windows
Delete the plugin from its installation coordinates.

## EMERGENCY BROADCAST

If all channels fail, transmit distress signal to:
- Repository: [ENCRYPTED]/spreadsheets-synth
- Frequency: @spreadsheets_band
- Underground SUBCulture: GitHub Issues
